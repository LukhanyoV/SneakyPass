# SneakyPass

This is my personal favourite tool, it helps me find saved WiFi passwords on my Windows based computer just in case I forget.

## How it works?

- Using it is really easy just run the file and the saved WiFi passwords will be in a file called "*WiFi Passwords.txt*"

- In some cases you may need to run the program with admin priviledges
